What is Python?
Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.

Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.

The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:

Machine Learning
GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )
Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)
Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)
Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
Test frameworks
Multimedia
Scientific computing
Text processing and many more..

Python 3 is a popular high-level programming language used for a wide variety of applications. Here are some basics of Python 3 that you should know:

Variables: In Python 3, variables are created by assigning a value to a name. For example, x = 5 creates a variable called x and assigns the value 5 to it.
Data types: Python 3 supports several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
Operators: Python 3 supports a variety of operators, including arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=), and logical operators (and, or, not).
Control flow statements: Python 3 supports several control flow statements, including if-else statements, for loops, and while loops. These statements allow you to control the flow of execution in your code.
Functions: In Python 3, functions are created using the def keyword. For example, def my_function(x): creates a function called my_function that takes one argument called x.
Input and output: In Python 3, you can use the input() function to get user input, and the print() function to output text to the console.

Modules: Python 3 supports modules, which are collections of functions and variables that can be imported and used in other Python code. You can import modules using the import keyword.
