Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language for managing data in a relational database management system. It's also used for stream processing in a relational data stream management system.SQL is used to create, store, update, and retrieve data. It's also used to access, maintain, and manipulate existing databases. 
SQL databases are collections of highly structured tables, where each row represents a data entity, and each column defines a specific information field. Relational databases store information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values. 
SQL defines three kinds of data types: 
Predefined data types
Constructed types
User-defined types
SQL is considered simpler to learn than Python because it only allows a limited number of operations. However, mastering its syntax and structures can take some time.
