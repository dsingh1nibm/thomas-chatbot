35
I will schedule a meeting with you all so that you can educate them on based on that we can get to know what all scenarios do they have around, which could be applied and automation could be done.

47


### "RAY" [None-None]
Absolutely.
48


### "Raje" [None-None]
Next time on once it's okay, I'll be there, but just for this, so for I think the two, which are there for me here there included for Generative AI because they are planned for agent Assistenia infused assist.
49
Adoption they had participated in the UAT and Alumin is actually onboarding for active and bluebody. So Blue Party is also part of the solution. So that is the reason they are here. So, I mean, how do you put it? I mean.
50


### "Bhatia" [None-None]
So.
51


### "Raje" [None-None]
You can, you can put agent as this proactive and blue good deployment in progress.
52


### "Bhatia" [None-None]
Agent assist.
53
Proactive and Liberty.
54
So I'm aware of this blue body. I saw the presentation call that they are providing some solution on the service now. So I think Lumini is interested in that.
55


### "Raje" [None-None]
Correct correct...
56


### "Bhatia" [None-None]
All right.
57


### "Raje" [None-None]
They are starting. I mean they are.
58


### "Bhatia" [None-None]
Discussion has been started.
59


### "Raje" [None-None]
Is that discussion has started the deployment? Is there anything proactive? Is it UAT is right now proactive?
60
So once proactive UAT is complete, then the blue party changes or they would start with their deployment, but they have all we have already given them the prerequisites and whatever is a ticket data. There was still details that they need for their internal, you know, model building at all.
61
So that we are satisfied and they would be starting.
62
Proactive.
63


### "Bhatia" [None-None]
Okay, and for this other account.
64


### "Raje" [None-None]
For a very source, basically I- they would be onboarding to this agent assist once it is, I think rolled out by, in November, right, that is what I hear. The plan is. So in the next six weeks we, once.
65
They would be onboarding to the Jennia platform feature to assist.
66


### "Bhatia" [None-None]
Okay.
67
This is not saying progress.
68


### "Raje" [None-None]
In progress or you can say plan it. I don't know how you want to put it. It is okay. I mean, I think from, from our side also, there are some, as in the infrastrated assist is not yet told out, so it is sort of once it is rolled out, this would be one of the first set of accounts.

133
We have created one small solution, so we have showcased in LNK, so I'll showcase you that solution in our next call, like I'll take five to ten minutes just to showcase that when our next call day after Tomorro.
134


### "BISWAS" [None-None]
We have to you, you what I would suggest you create a list of all the current existing offerings, like, for example, Obish.
135
Previously, I mean seen various calls, he has shown to different offerings. One.
136
Cl one that invoice, and then the invoicing related thing, then we have what you are saying now that one can be included, in addition to that, the other regular stuffs, like the agent assistant, the more formal product type things.
137


### "Bhatia" [None-None]
That we have.
138


### "BISWAS" [None-None]
So, so created a list of those. I believe we need a PPT covering all those tools and.
139
Products, and then we.
140
Call with the account and showcase them. So.
141
So basically that is the target and regarding the after tomorrow, which I will be off for next few days.
142
So.
143
Holidays as well as.
144
Plans during the period. So on thirtieth.
145
Not with yet.
146

147


### "Bhatia" [None-None]

148


### "BISWAS" [None-None]

149


### "Bhatia" [None-None]
Coming office too. Are you coming off?
150


### "BISWAS" [None-None]
I'm going on deep.
151
So if you can get more, you can try to schedule this call since you tried to reach him once before, and if we can plan this after I come back also.
152


### "Bhatia" [None-None]
SUSHA.
153


### "BISWAS" [None-None]
If you need some time to prepare and prepare yourself in term.
154
Getting all the Pvts, everything, all the details for all.
155


### "Bhatia" [None-None]
That I need to create as well as the solution that is also not working perfectly. So.
156


### "BISWAS" [None-None]
You are saying, but for the other solutions, I, I believe most of the things are there, they are in the sense PPTS presentations, everything are there.
157
They have to job just bring everything at a single place and consize that.
158
Remember this agent assistance, the PPTS, everything is there right? Plus the two offerings that shared in different calls, the invoice one and IC one.
159
So the Ppts and those details are already there.
160
To bring them under one umbrella. All of them, you can discuss it also.
161
So based on that pre- production, we can plan these call with excess.
162
