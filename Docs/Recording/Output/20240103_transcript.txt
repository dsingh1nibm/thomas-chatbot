This is Spunam. Can, can I actually give my updates next? I have to drop off.
45


### "Prikshit Bhatia" [00:12:05.820-00:12:07.100]
Sure, sure, yeah.
46
For initial calls, like.
47


### "ARNAB RAY" [00:12:09.740-00:12:10.300]
Absolutely.
48


### "Poonam Raje" [00:12:30.900-00:12:51.260]
Next time on once it's okay, I'll be there, but just for this, so for I think the two, which are there for me here there included for Generative AI because they are planned for agent Assistenia infused assist.
49
Adoption they had participated in the UAT and Alumin is actually onboarding for active and bluebody. So Blue Party is also part of the solution. So that is the reason they are here. So, I mean, how do you put it? I mean.
50


### "Prikshit Bhatia" [00:12:52.540-00:12:53.180]
So.
51


### "Poonam Raje" [00:12:54.300-00:13:01.340]
You can, you can put agent as this proactive and blue good deployment in progress.
52


### "Prikshit Bhatia" [00:13:14.940-00:13:27.500]
Agent assist.
53
Proactive and Liberty.
54
So I'm aware of this blue body. I saw the presentation call that they are providing some solution on the service now. So I think Lumini is interested in that.
55


### "Poonam Raje" [00:13:27.740-00:13:29.020]
Correct correct...
56


### "Prikshit Bhatia" [00:13:29.020-00:13:30.300]
All right.
57


### "Poonam Raje" [00:13:33.500-00:13:36.700]
They are starting. I mean they are.
58


### "Prikshit Bhatia" [00:13:37.060-00:13:39.020]
Discussion has been started.
59


### "Poonam Raje" [00:14:16.660-00:14:17.780]
Is that discussion has started the deployment? Is there anything proactive? Is it UAT is right now proactive?
60
So once proactive UAT is complete, then the blue party changes or they would start with their deployment, but they have all we have already given them the prerequisites and whatever is a ticket data. There was still details that they need for their internal, you know, model building at all.
61
So that we are satisfied and they would be starting.
62
Proactive.
63


### "Prikshit Bhatia" [00:14:18.940-00:14:23.380]
Okay, and for this other account.
64


### "Poonam Raje" [00:14:45.900-00:14:49.940]
For a very source, basically I- they would be onboarding to this agent assist once it is, I think rolled out by, in November, right, that is what I hear. The plan is. So in the next six weeks we, once.
65
They would be onboarding to the Jennia platform feature to assist.
66


### "Prikshit Bhatia" [00:15:04.380-00:15:06.580]
Okay.
67
This is not saying progress.
68


### "Poonam Raje" [00:15:08.220-00:15:28.700]
In progress or you can say plan it. I don't know how you want to put it. It is okay. I mean, I think from, from our side also, there are some, as in the infrastrated assist is not yet told out, so it is sort of once it is rolled out, this would be one of the first set of accounts.
69


### "Prikshit Bhatia" [00:15:42.140-00:15:45.340]
Okay.

135
Previously, I mean seen various calls, he has shown to different offerings. One.
136

138


### "SUDIP BISWAS" [00:24:52.400-00:24:53.040]

139
Products, and then we.
140
Call with the account and showcase them. So.
141
So basically that is the target and regarding the after tomorrow, which I will be off for next few days.

152


### "Prikshit Bhatia" [00:25:14.800-00:25:15.920]
SUSHA.
153


### "SUDIP BISWAS" [00:25:21.840-00:25:25.040]
If you need some time to prepare and prepare yourself in term.
154

155


### "Prikshit Bhatia" [00:25:25.680-00:25:33.360]
That I need to create as well as the solution that is also not working perfectly. So.
156


### "SUDIP BISWAS" [00:26:43.840-00:26:51.440]
You are saying, but for the other solutions, I, I believe most of the things are there, they are in the sense PPTS presentations, everything are there.
157
They have to job just bring everything at a single place and consize that.
158
Remember this agent assistance, the PPTS, everything is there right? Plus the two offerings that shared in different calls, the invoice one and IC one.
159
So the Ppts and those details are already there.
160
To bring them under one umbrella. All of them, you can discuss it also.
161
So based on that pre- production, we can plan these call with excess.
162
And for Bioet, very recently means I'm not involved in that discussion till now, but very recently Rajendro had some discussion with the account where account has shown some interest get in touch with Rajindro, once I also have to get the details from him and see.
